# Record how stupid ABC is

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @[cattouch](https://github.com/cattouch),a student who hates liars.</br>
You need to know that the ABC here refers to **[Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/)**


## [What is ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation)

> The **Australian Broadcasting Corporation** (**ABC**), formerly the **Australian Broadcasting Commission**, is Australia's [national broadcaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting).



## Why I hate ABC

As a government-funded public broadcaster, ABC claims to be independent of government, political groups, business or other industry bodies, but outside of its normal news reporting, there are always unthinkable things happening that make you wonder if it is not an independent media and may have been influenced by government/capital.

>  [It is principally funded by the direct grants from the Australian Government, and is administered by a board appointed by the government of the day. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation)
